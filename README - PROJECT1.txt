Easy Initial State: 3 1 2 x 4 5 6 7 8
Hard Initial State: x 1 3 5 6 2 4 6 8

Easy Output: x 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Hard Output: x 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Data Structures/Functions used:

Queue - BFS uses FIFO

_BFS - constructor used to initialize board

PrintBFS - prints current state board

USER_INPUT - receives user input for initial and goal states

MoveZeroUp - moves the blank space upwards

MoveZeroDown - moves the blank space downwards

MoveZeroLeft - moves the blank space leftwards

MoveZeroRight - moves the blank space rightwards

Move - decides how to move the blank space

Encode - represents current state by a single number

Decode - reverses effects of encode function

SearchSolution - uses BFS to traverse through tree and find a solution
